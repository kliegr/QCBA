Title: Postprocessing of Rule Classification Models Learnt on Quantized Data
Version: 1.0.1

Maintainer: Tom치코 Kliegr <kliegr@gmail.com>
Description: Implements the Quantitative Classification-based on
    Association Rules (QCBA)  algorithm (<doi:10.1007/s10489-022-04370-x>). 
    QCBA postprocesses rule classification models making them typically smaller and in some cases more accurate. 
    Supported are 'CBA' implementations from 'rCBA', 'arulesCBA' and 'arc' packages, and 'CPAR', 'CMAR', 'FOIL2' and 'PRM' implementations 
    from 'arulesCBA' package and 'SBRL' implementation from the 'sbrl' package. The result of the post-processing is an ordered CBA-like rule list.
