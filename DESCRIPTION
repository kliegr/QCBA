Description: Implements the Quantitative Classification-based on
    Association Rules (QCBA)  algorithm (Tomáš Kliegr and Ebroul Izquierdo (2023) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04370-x>). QCBA postprocesses rule classification models making them typically smaller and in some cases more accurate. 
    The package postprocess models generated by several rule learning algorithms: CBA, CMAR, CPAR, FOIL2, PRM, IDS, SBRL. 
    Supported implementations of CBA include rCBA, arulesCBA and arc packages. Supported implementation of CPAR, CMAR, FOIL2, PRM is from arulesCBA.
    The package also postprocess results of the SBRL package, which is no longer in CRAN, but can be obtained from <https://github.com/cran/sbrl>.
