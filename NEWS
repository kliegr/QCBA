* Improved confidence estimation on the output of the prune function: In addition to standard measured computed by the arules library, new slots are available for each rule -- orderedConf and orderedSupp. Order-sensitive confidence  is computed only from instances reaching the given rule as a/(a+b), where a is the number of instances matching both the antecedent (available as slot orderedSupp) and consequent and b is the number of instances matching the antecedent, but not matching the consequent of the given rule.
